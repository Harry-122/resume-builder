    \item Designed a secure client-server messaging system using Java sockets and RSA (2048-bit) public-private key cryptography, enabling real-time delivery of digitally signed and encrypted messages with timestamp integrity checks using SHA256-based digital signatures and MD5 hashing.
    \item Developed bidirectional authentication, key-based encryption, and signature verification pipelines, storing and relaying Base64-encoded messages across distributed nodes while ensuring tamper resistance, identity protection, and efficient message parsing via byte-level framing.
