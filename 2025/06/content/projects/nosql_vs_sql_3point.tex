    \item Implemented a MongoDB-based cloud solution to process and analyze Twitter data (Tweet ID, Reach, Sentiment, Location), automating the transformation of 100,000+ CSV records into structured JSON datasets and loading them into MongoDB Atlas Cloud.
    \item Optimized MongoDB query performance by indexing LocationID and Country fields, improving response time by 40\% (down to 7ms) through strategic data selection, projection, filtering, and aggregation, enabling real-time business insights.
    \item Conducted a MongoDB vs SQL performance benchmark, enhancing query execution efficiency on 10,000+ tweets, achieving a 15\% speed improvement. Demonstrated the scalability of NoSQL cloud solutions through query optimization and Agile-driven system analysis.
