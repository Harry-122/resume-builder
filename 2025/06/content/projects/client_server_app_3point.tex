    \item Designed and developed a highly secure client-server messaging system using Java socket programming, implementing RSA encryption (RSA/ECB/PKCS1Padding) and digital signatures (SHA256withRSA) for secure authentication and 100\% encrypted communication.
    \item Applied MD5 hashing for user identity protection, ensuring complete anonymization of stored user data, preventing unauthorized access, and guaranteeing zero plaintext message leaks, even in the event of server compromise.
    \item Engineered an optimized encryption workflow for secure message storage and relay via an intermediary server, enhancing key management, signature validation, and end-to-end security, doubling message retrieval speed for high-performance communication.
