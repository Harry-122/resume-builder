\begin{tightemize}
    \item Designed a domain-specific language (DSL) in Xtext to model Spring Boot applications, supporting annotated entities, relationships, cardinalities, and constraints; enabled automated generation of JPA repositories, DTOs, and REST APIs from concise schema definitions.
    \item Developed a Groovy-based generator that parses the DSL and constructs full Spring Boot project skeletons including pom.xml, configurations, controllers, services, and entities; resolved grammar ambiguities and ensured scalable, domain-driven structure using EMF and code templating.
