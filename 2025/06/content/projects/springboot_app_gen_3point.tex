\begin{tightemize}
    \item Engineered a Spring Boot project generator leveraging Xtext and Groovy, automating the creation of essential components such as pom.xml, application.properties, SpringBootApplication.java, entities, DTOs, repositories, services, and controllers, tailored for a Twitter-like schema (users, tweets, likes, followers).
    \item Designed a custom domain-specific language (DSL) using Xtext, enabling seamless definition of Spring Boot project models with annotations, cardinalities, and complex entity relationships (e.g., @OneToMany, @ManyToOne), alongside automated JPA repository generation.
    \item Developed a Groovy-based code generator, transforming DSL models into Spring Boot project skeletons, efficiently resolving Xtext grammar conflicts, automating REST API generation, and ensuring scalability through domain-driven design (DDD) principles.
